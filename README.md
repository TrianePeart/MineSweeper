# MineSweeper

While working on a project [Pixel Printer](https://github.com/TrianePeart/8-0-events-lab) with my lab partner we started discussing mine sweeper and how fun it was. So I made one. 

I learned this coding from my time at Access Manhattan and do not remember my professor shout out to him though. 

I also had help from my classmates [Benny Zheng](https://github.com/BennyZ3) and Melissa Lopez on creating up to date readable code.
